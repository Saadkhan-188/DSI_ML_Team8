## Overview

This project explores the [TTC Subway Delay Data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-delay-data/) provided by the Toronto Transit Commission. By applying machine learning techniques and visual analytics, our team will identify patterns and potential predictive signals for subway delays, focusing on time-based features and operational categories.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this sprint, we aim to:

1. Apply technical skills across EDA, regression, time series modeling, and Git collaboration  
2. Build a portfolio-ready, reproducible data science project  
3. Work collaboratively using GitHub, Notion, and Slack  
4. Communicate results clearly through a README, visualizations, and a final presentation

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: [TTC Subway Delay Data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-delay-data/)
- **Publisher**: Toronto Transit Commission  
- **Last Refreshed**: June 30, 2025  
- **Description**: Monthly delay logs across TTC subway lines including time, location, delay cause, duration, and other metadata  
- **Goal**: Identify delay trends, engineer time-based features, and evaluate predictive models for delay classification or duration estimation

## Tools & Libraries

We expect to use:

- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation  
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) for numerical operations  
- [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) for modeling  
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) and [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for visualization  
- [`Prophet`](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) or [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) for time series (TBD)  
- [`SHAP`](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for explainability (optional)  
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control  
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) for async communication  
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/DSI-ML-Team-8-233898e03e6b80b5af9cd0be21df8599) for documentation & Kanban  

Reflection videos will be linked in this README.

## Getting Started

This is a 10-day team sprint running from **July 17 to July 26, 2025**. All work will be documented in GitHub, with daily async check-ins on Slack and Notion.
